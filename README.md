# Machine Learning for Image Denoising

This project focuses on implementing and experimenting with **FFDNet** algorithm, as described in the paper ["FFDNet: Toward a Fast and Flexible Solution for CNN based Image Denoising"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04026). Our goal is to explore its performance on verious image datasets and evaluate its robustness when trained and tested on different types of noise.
We will also explore the use of **diffusion models** for image denoising, aiming to understand and compare their methodology with CNN-based approaches like FFDNet.
